## Introduction

Burp suit is used to test web & mobile apps. It allows us to view, and edit http/https traffic.
Some features include:

- **Proxy**: Burp Proxy operates as a web proxy server between the browser and target applications. It enables you to intercept, inspect, and modify traffic that passes in both directions. You can even use this to test using HTTPS. 
- **Repeater**: Repeater allows for capturing, modifying, and re-sending the same request multiple times
