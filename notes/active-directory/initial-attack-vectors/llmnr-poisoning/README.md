# [What's LLMNR?]()

**LLMNR** stands for **Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution**. This is used if the DNS is not in use.  It is a protocol used on local networks to resolve the names of computers (hostnames) to their respective IP addresses without requiring a DNS server. LLMNR operates on the local link (Layer 2) and uses multicast communication to perform name resolution. It is primarily used in small networks or environments where a DNS server is unavailable.
