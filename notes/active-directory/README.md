# Introduction

Directory service was developed by Microsoft to manage windows domain networks. Roughly **90%** of organisations worldwide use Active Directory as the user identity repository, acting as the primary source of trust for identity and access. It stores information related to objects such as computers, users, printers (like a phonebook, or identity management system). Authenticates using Kerberos tickets (non windows devices like Linux, firewalls, printers can be authenticated using Active Directory (AD) via RADIUS or LDAP)

AD can be exploited without ever attacking pachable exploits. Instead attacker abuse features, trusts components and more.
