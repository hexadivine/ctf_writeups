After vulnerability scanning the next step is exploitation. In this phase we try to gain service/user level access of the server.

- Check [this](https://hexadivine.gitbook.io/hrushikeshdolas/notes/methodology/exploitation/common-exploits) page for more on common exploits.
- For brute-force using hydra check [this](https://hexadivine.gitbook.io/hrushikeshdolas/notes/tools/hydra) page.
- Check out more about metasploit for exploitation; however it's not allowed in OSCP.
