# Introduction

**IDOR** or **Insecure Direct Object Reference** refers to an access control vulnerability where you can access resources you wouldn't ordinarily be able to see. This occurs when the programmer exposes a Direct Object Reference (mean a file, a user, a bank account in a banking application, or anything really)

For example, let's say we're logging into our bank account, and after correctly authenticating ourselves, we get taken to a URL like this `https://bank.thm/account?id=111111`. On that page, we can see all our important bank details, and a user would do whatever they need to do and move along their way, thinking nothing is wrong.

There is, however, a potentially huge problem here, anyone may be able to change the `id` parameter to something else like `222222`, and if the site is incorrectly configured, then he would have access to someone else's bank information.
