## Introduction

**Active recon** requires you to interact with target to gather the information. This contact can be a phone call or a visit to the target company under some pretence to gather more information, usually as part of social engineering. Alternatively, it can be a direct connection to the target system, whether visiting their website or checking if their firewall has an SSH port open. Think of it like you are closely inspecting windows and door locks. Hence, it is essential to remember not to engage in active reconnaissance work before getting signed legal authorisation from the client.

## Web-browser

There are also plenty of add-ons for Firefox and Chrome that can help in penetration testing. Here are a few examples:

- **Developer tools** lets you inspect many things that your browser has received and exchanged with the remote server.
- **FoxyProxy** lets you quickly change the proxy server you are using to access the target website. This browser extension is convenient when you are using a tool such as Burp Suite or if you need to switch proxy servers regularly. You can get FoxyProxy for Firefox from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard).
- **User-Agent Switcher and Manager** gives you the ability to pretend to be accessing the webpage from a different operating system or different web browser. In other words, you can pretend to be browsing a site using an iPhone when in fact, you are accessing it from Mozilla Firefox. You can download User-Agent Switcher and Manager for Firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-string-switcher).
- **Wappalyzer** provides insights about the technologies used on the visited websites. Such extension is handy, primarily when you collect all this information while browsing the website like any other user. A screenshot of Wappalyzer is shown below. You can find Wappalyzer for Firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer).
