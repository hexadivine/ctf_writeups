## Introduction

- "To outsmart a hacker, you need to think like one."
- It involves breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access. 
- The goal is to understand hacker tactics and enhance our system defences.

## Careers in cyber security (extra)

In cybersecurity, red teaming is a specialized, offensive role where security professionals simulate real-world cyber-attacks to test an organization’s defenses. It’s highly hands-on and proactive, often requiring skills in penetration testing, ethical hacking, and adversarial simulation. Here are some common careers within red teaming:

### 1. **Red Team Operator**

- **Role:** Executes simulated attacks, aiming to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and networks.
- **Skills Needed:** Strong knowledge of penetration testing, scripting, exploit development, malware analysis, and networking.
- **Certifications:** Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP), and GIAC Penetration Tester (GPEN).

### 2. **Red Team Lead**

- **Role:** Oversees red team operations, plans engagements, manages team members, and collaborates with blue teams to enhance organizational security.
- **Skills Needed:** Advanced technical skills in red teaming, leadership abilities, strategic thinking, and experience with attack simulation frameworks.
- **Certifications:** OSCE (Offensive Security Certified Expert), CREST certifications, and managerial certifications like CISSP.

### 3. **Threat Emulation Specialist**

- **Role:** Focuses on replicating tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by advanced threat actors to test and improve detection and defense mechanisms.
- **Skills Needed:** Deep knowledge of threat intelligence, TTPs, adversary simulation, and familiarity with frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK.
- **Certifications:** CREST Certified Threat Intelligence Analyst (CCTIA), GIAC Cyber Threat Intelligence (GCTI).

### 4. **Red Team Consultant**

- **Role:** Provides consulting services for multiple organizations, assessing their security maturity and delivering red team exercises.
- **Skills Needed:** Strong communication, reporting, and customer-facing skills, alongside advanced red teaming and cybersecurity expertise.
- **Certifications:** OSCP, OSCE, CRTO (Certified Red Team Operator).

### 5. **Purple Team Specialist**

- **Role:** Bridges the gap between red and blue teams, helping to improve defensive strategies based on red team findings.
- **Skills Needed:** Knowledge of both red and blue team tactics, collaboration skills, familiarity with defense tools, and ability to design joint simulations.
- **Certifications:** CRTO, GPEN, GIAC Defensible Security Architecture (GDSA).

### 6. **Adversarial Engineer / Exploit Developer**

- **Role:** Designs custom exploits and attack methods to simulate sophisticated threat actor capabilities.
- **Skills Needed:** Strong programming skills, reverse engineering, malware development, and exploit development.
- **Certifications:** OSCE, Certified Exploit Developer (CrED), GIAC Reverse Engineering Malware (GREM).

### 7. **Social Engineering Specialist**

- **Role:** Focuses on social engineering techniques to test the human element of security by manipulating employees through phishing, impersonation, or pretexting.
- **Skills Needed:** Strong interpersonal and social engineering skills, psychology knowledge, and understanding of social engineering attack vectors.
- **Certifications:** Certified Social Engineering Expert (CSEE), EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH).

Red teaming roles in cybersecurity are highly dynamic and demanding, with a continual need to stay updated on emerging threats and attack methods.
